## üèÜ Objective
Create a responsive timeline using HTML and CSS that displays events in chronological order. The timeline should adapt to different screen sizes, providing a clear and visually appealing layout on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üéØ Key Objectives:
- **Header:** A title for the timeline, such as "History of the Internet" or "Company Milestones".
- **Timeline Events:** A series of events, each with a date, title, description, and optionally an image or icon. Events are arranged either vertically or horizontally, depending on the screen size.
- **Responsive Layout:** On larger screens, the timeline can be presented in a two-column layout with events alternating left and right. On smaller screens, the timeline should stack vertically for easy reading.
- **Visual Indicators:** Use lines or dots to visually connect events and indicate the passage of time.
- **Footer:** An optional footer summarizing the timeline or providing additional information.

## üéÆ Mission Progress
### HTML Structure:
- [ ] `<div>` containers for each event, with nested elements like `<h2>, <p>, <img>`, and `<span>` for date, title, description, and icons/images.
- [ ] Use of semantic elements like `<article>` for individual events or <aside> for side content.

### CSS Styling:
- [ ] Flexbox or Grid layout for arranging the timeline and events.
- [ ] Styling for date and event content, ensuring clarity and readability.
- [ ] Use of lines, dots, or other visual markers to indicate the timeline's progression.

### Responsive Design:
- [ ] Media queries to adjust layout and styling for different screen sizes.
- [ ] Flexbox or Grid properties to change the arrangement of events (e.g., alternating side layout on desktop and vertical stacking on mobile).

### Visual Design:
- [ ] Consistent color scheme and typography for a cohesive look.
- [ ] Use of icons or images to enhance visual appeal and convey additional information.
